## Known rule gaps

Rules from the rulebook that the competition code does not handle yet:

- **Double disqualification or double forfeit in a semi-final** (Art. 14): the two quarter-final losers should wrestle a replacement semi-final, and the repechage groups change with its result. Currently the final side stays vacant.
- **Medal reassignment after doping disqualification** (Art. 14): an administrative step after the event; not modelled.

## Next systems

In dependency order:

1. Team competitions (World Cup dual meets, Art. 33)
2. Weigh-in procedure and tolerance per event type, using the ruleset
3. Event scheduling (sessions, mats, 20-minute rest, two-day categories)
4. Wrestler model (attributes, body, repertoire, condition)
5. Match engine (body state, grips, techniques, officials, scoring evaluator)
